	<h1>WebDevEnvironment Installation Guide</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>To install the API, upload all files onto your server. Once they are uploaded, the database needs to be installed.</li>
		<li>Configure the <code>inc/config.php</code> file has the correct details in in the following sections; DBHOST, DBUSER and DBPASS. <br />
			By default they are set to: <br />
			<ul>
				<li>DBHOST: &#39;localhost&#39;</li>
				<li>DBUSER: &#39;root&#39;</li>
				<li>DBPASS: &#39;root&#39;</li>
				<li>DBNAME: &#39;WebDevEnvironment&#39;</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<p><strong>Note: DBNAME should not be changed!</strong></p>
		<li>Once the information matches the same as your server's information (IP address, database username and database password for that user), run the file <code>inc/setup.php</code>.
			Providing that the correct information was inserted into the required variables, you will be redirected to <code>index.php</code></li>
		<p>You're now good to go! Direct youself to index.php and begin using WebDevEnvironment.</p>
